/*
 This game is a very simple knock off of Monopoly.
 
 It is set up using an IIFE to create a Game object. 
 
 Then there are two types of ojbects used to create the game:
    Square objects to represent the squares on the board (all known as properties, 
	  but I'm mostly calling them Squares to avoid confusion with object properties).
	  These store value, rent, name, etc. 
	Player objects, representing the different players in the game. These store name,
	  cash, ID, etc.
 These objects are created at the beginning of the game (within the Game object)
 and are updated as the game progresses.
 
 The players roll the dice and progress around the board. They can buy property when they
 land on an open square. First player to go below $0 loses.
 
 There are some limitations on what you can do in this game based on the amount of time I have left for this project:
 1. two fixed players
 2. no selling to other player
 3. no auction
 4. no houses or hotels
 5. no mortgages
